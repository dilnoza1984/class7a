Generating and using a random mock data is common in testing.
 
Create a static method printRandomSSN() in the given Utilities class that generates a random SSN and prints it.

Call your method in the main method to verify your output.

Examples:
 
 printRandomSSN() -> 123-53-3121
 printRandomSSN() -> 956-99-4209

(Extra: Adjust your code so that your method can also print such values as 001-00-0101, 034-0078-0432, etc)
